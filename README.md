# Data Parallel Programming, Block 2 2021

PFP is structured around five weeks with lectures and lab sessions
on TODO and TODO, followed by a final project to be
presented orally at the exam.  Throughout the course, you will hand in
four weekly assignments.  These *weeklies* count for 40\% of the
grade, while the exam counts for 60\%.

The teachers are **Cosmin Oancea** and **Troels Henriksen**.

All lectures and lab sessions will be delivered in English.  The
assignments and projects will be posted in English, and while you can
chose to hand in solutions in either English or Danish, English is
preferred.

All course material is distributed via this GitHub page.  Assignment
handin is still on Absalon.  There is no mandated textbook for the
course - you will be assigned reading material from papers and such.
